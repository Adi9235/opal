title: Welcome to OPAL üëã
---

**OPAL** stands for **Open Policy Administration Layer**. OPAL is a layer for the **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**, allowing us to detect changes
made to our policies and data, and thus pushing live real-time updates to your agents.

OPAL is designed to work with **live applications**, and bring open-policy to a real-time speed. As updates are pushed to application
stores - this could be your Git, your databases, SaaS services and so on - **OPAL will make sure the services are always in sync**
with the authorization data and policy they need, and more importantly, **only** the services that they need.
