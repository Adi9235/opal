# Setup OPAL as Python Packages using the CLI

This guide will teach you how to setup the OPAL Server & Client as a series of python packages using the CLI.

This guide will give you a great insight into understanding the main configurations of OPAL. If you prefer to run OPAL with
pre-built docker images, please follow the guide **[here](/getting-started/running-opal/overview)**.

:::warning IMPORTANT
This guide requires that you have **python 3.7 or greater** installed.

Ideally, install OPAL into a **clean [virtual-env](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)**
would make the workflow easier.
