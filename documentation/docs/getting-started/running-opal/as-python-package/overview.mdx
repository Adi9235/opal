# Get started with OPAL python packages ðŸš€

This guide will teach you how to setup and use OPAL as Python packages (python 3.7 >) with its CLI

## TL;DR

- Install
  - `pip install opal-client`
  - `pip install opal-server`
- Run server (example):
  ```sh
  # Run server
  #  in secure mode -verifying client JWTs (Replace secrets with actual secrets ;-) )
  export OPAL_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=~/opal
  export OPAL_AUTH_PUBLIC_KEY=~/opal.pub
  export OPAL_AUTH_MASTER_TOKEN="RANDOM-SECRET-STRING"
  #  Watching a GIT repository from a webhook
  export OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo.git
  export OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET="RANDOM-SECRET-STRING-SHARED-WITH-GITHUB"
  opal-server run
  ```
- Run client (example):
  ```sh
  # Run client
  #  authenticating with a JWT (replace 'JWT-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-CONTENT' with actual token )
  export OPAL_CLIENT_TOKEN="JWT-CRYPTOGRAPHIC-CONTENT"
  # connect to server
  export OPAL_SERVER_URL=https://opal.mydomain.com:7002
  # Subscribe to specific data-topics
  export OPAL_DATA_TOPICS=tenants/my-org,stripe_billing,tickets
  opal-client run
  ```

## Intro

Getting Started with OPAL is easy - we'll install our OPAL-server to manage all the OPAL-client's we deploy.
We'll deploy OPAL-clients (along side policy agents).

This HOW-TO focuses on setting-up OPAL with its packages and CLI interface, this guide is better to understand the main configurations of OPAL. There's also a separate guide for [setting-up OPAL from pre-built docker images](/getting-started/running-opal/as-docker-image/overview).

### NOTES:

- Make sure your system is running Python 3.7 or higher

- Ideally install OPAL into a clean [virtual-env](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

- Both opal-server and opal-client can be configured using environment-variables, [.env / .ini](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/#env-file) files , and command-line options (later overrides previous).

- Passing lists (e.g. client's `--data-topics`):

  - pass delimited by "," with env-vars i.e. `OPAL_DATA_TOPICS=topic1,topic2,topic3 opal-client run`
  - and as multi-options for cmd options i.e. `opal-client --data-topics topics1 --data-topics topics2 --data-topics topics3 run`

- Top-level CLI options listed in `--help` are available under the same name as env-vars (simply convert to uppercase and replace "-" with "\_", prefix with 'OPAL' )
  for example `OPAL_SERVER_PORT=1337 opal-server run` is equivalent to `opal-server --server-port 1337 run`
