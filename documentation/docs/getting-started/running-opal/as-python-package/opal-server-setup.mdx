# Setup OPAL Server

1. ### Install OPAL-server using pip

   ```sh
   pip install opal-server
   ```

   - Once installed your shell will have access to the `opal-server` command.

     </p>

   - if the command isn't available try deactivating/activating the virtual-env
   - run `opal-server --help` to see all the options and commands
   - run the `opal-server print-config` to see all the possible configuration keys and their values (as read from defaults, evn-vars, .env, .ini, and the command-line)

2. ### Run opal-server

   ### Simple run with GIT repo watching

   - We can run the server with the run command - i.e. `opal-server run`
   - Once the server is running you can check out its Open-API live docs at [/docs](http://localhost:7002/docs) or [/redoc](http://localhost:7002/redoc) (These links assume you have the server running on locally the default port - **localhost:7002** )

   - ### Polling Policy from GIT:

     - The most basic way to run the server is just with a GIT repository to watch for policy-changes and get the policy from.
     - Simplest of those is using a public repository, and simply polling on it (with `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL` and `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_POLLING_INTERVAL`)
       ```sh
       #Have the opal server monitor a repo every 60 seconds
       OPAL_POLICY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/permitio/opal-example-policy-repo.git  opal-server --policy-repo-polling-interval 60 run
       ```
       {" "}

         </a>
       </p>

   - ### Policy GIT Webhook:

     - Better GIT watching can be achieved via configuring a webhook back to the OPAL_SERVER's webhook route. Say your server is hosted on `opal.yourdomain.com` the webhook URL will be `opal.yourdomain.com/webhook`
     - see [GitHub's guide on configuring webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/creating-webhooks)
     - use `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to configure a secret you can share with the webhook provider (authenticating incoming webhooks)
       - you can use `opal-server generate-secret` to create a cryptographically strong secret to use

   - ### Additional GIT repository settings
     - Use `POLICY_REPO_SSH_KEY` to authenticate to a **private repository** (see Git hosts for hot to configure the key - for example- [Github SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))
       - The passed value for key can either be a file path, or the contents of the SSH-key (with newlines replaced with '\_')
     - Use `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_CLONE_PATH`, `OPAL_POLICY_REPO_MAIN_BRANCH`, etc. to control how the repo is cloned

   ### Simple run with Data source configuration

   In addition to policy updates (as seen in above section) the OPAL-server can also facilitate data updates, directing OPAL-clients to fetch the needed data from various sources.
   see [how to trigger data updates guide](/tutorials/trigger_data_updates)
   CLI example:

     </a>
   </p>

   ### Production run

   For production we should set the server to work with a production server ([GUNICORN](https://gunicorn.org/)) and backbone pub/sub.

   - Gunicorn

     - simply use the `run` command with the `--engine-type gunicorn` option.

     ```sh
     opal-server run --engine-type gunicorn
     ```

     - (run `opal-server run --help` to see more info on the `run` command)
     - use `--server-worker-count` to control the amount of workers (default is set to cpu-count)
     - You can of course put another server or proxy (e.g. NGNIX, ENVOY) in front of the OPAL-SERVER, instead of or in addition to Gunicorn

   - Backbone Pub/Sub

     - While OPAL-servers provide a lightweight websocket pub/sub channel for the clients; in order for all OPAL-servers (workers of same server, and of course servers on other nodes) to be synced (And in turn their clients to be synced) they need to connect through a shared channel - which we refer to as the backbone pub/sub or broadcast channel.
     - Backbone Pub/Sub options: Kafka, Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY, Redis
     - Use the `broadcast-uri` option (or `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI` env-var) to configure an OPAL-server to work with a backbone.
     - for example `OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://localhost/mydb opal-server run`

   - Put it all together:
     ```sh
     OPAL_BROADCAST_URI=postgres://localhost/mydb opal-server run --engine-type gunicorn
     ```
