# OPAL Helm Chart for Kubernetes

OPAL is an administration layer for Open Policy Agent (OPA), detecting changes to both policy and policy data in realtime
and pushing live updates to your agents.

OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications. As your application state changes
(whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are
always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need).

## Installation Guide

OPAL Helm chart could be installed only with Helm 3. The chart is published to public Helm repository, hosted on GitHub
itself. It's recommended to install OPAL into a dedicated namespace.

### Add Helm repository

```
$ helm repo add opal https://permitio.github.io/opal-helm-chart
$ helm repo update
```

### Install the latest version

```
$ helm install --create-namespace -n opal-ns myopal opal/opal
```

### Search for all available versions

```
$ helm search repo opal --versions
```

## Deploy OPAL to your Kubernetes cluster

### Install specific version (with default configuration):

```
$ helm install --create-namespace -n opal-ns --version x.x.x myopal opal/opal
```

### Install specific version (with custom configuration provided as YAML):

```
$ helm install -f myvalues.yaml --create-namespace -n opal-ns --version x.x.x myopal opal/opal
```

`myvalues.yaml` must conform to the json schema.

## Verify installation

OPAL Client should populate embedded OPA instance with polices and data from configured Git repository. To validate it - one could create port-forwarding to OPAL client Pod. Port 8181 is the embedded OPA agent.

```
$ kubectl port-forward -n opal-ns service/myopal-client 8181:8181
```

Then, open `http://localhost:8181/v1/data/` in your browser to check OPA data document state.
