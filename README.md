## What is OPAL?
OPAL is an administration layer for <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a>, detecting changes to both policy and policy data in realtime and pushing live updates to your agents. OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications.

As your application state changes (whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need).

Check out our main site at <a href="https://opal.ac">OPAL.ac</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/tG8jrdcc7Zo">this video</a> briefly explaining OPAL and how it works with OPA.

## Why use OPAL?
OPAL is the easiest way to keep your solution's authorization layer up-to-date in realtime. It aggregates policy and data from across the field and integrates them seamlessly into the authorization layer, and  is microservices and cloud-native. 

## OPA + OPAL = üíú
While OPA (Open Policy Agent) decouples policy from code in a highly-performant and elegant way, the challege of keeping policy agents up-to-date remains. 
This is especially true in applications, where each user interaction or API call may affect access-control decisions.
OPAL runs in the background, supercharging policy-agents, keeping them in sync with events in realtime.
