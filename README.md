## What is OPAL?
OPAL is an administration layer for <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent (OPA)</a>, detecting changes to both policy and policy data in realtime and pushing live updates to your agents. OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications.

As your application state changes (whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need).

Check out our main site at <a href="https://opal.ac">OPAL.ac</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/tG8jrdcc7Zo">this video</a> briefly explaining OPAL and how it works with OPA.

## Why use OPAL?
OPAL is the easiest way to keep your solution's authorization layer up-to-date in realtime. It aggregates policy and data from across the field and integrates them seamlessly into the authorization layer, and  is microservices and cloud-native. 

## OPA + OPAL = üíú
While OPA (Open Policy Agent) decouples policy from code in a highly-performant and elegant way, the challege of keeping policy agents up-to-date remains. 
This is especially true in applications, where each user interaction or API call may affect access-control decisions.
OPAL runs in the background, supercharging policy-agents, keeping them in sync with events in realtime.

## Documentation 

- üìÉ &nbsp; [Full documentation is available here](docs/index.md) 
- üí° &nbsp; [Intro to OPAL](docs/intro.md) 
- üí™ &nbsp; [Getting Started](docs/HOWTO/get_started_with_opal_python_packages.md) -
OPAL is available both as **python packages** with a built-in CLI as well as pre-built **docker images** ready-to-go.

    Getting started with the pre-built docker containers:
   
   [Play with a live playground environment in docker-compose](docs/HOWTO/get_started_with_opal_docker_compose_tutorial.md)
   <!-- - this tutorial is great for learning about OPAL core features and see what OPAL can do for you. -->
   [Try the getting started guide for containers](docs/HOWTO/get_started_with_opal_using_docker.md)
   <!-- - this tutorial will show you how to configure OPAL to your specific needs and run the official docker containers locally or in production. -->
   [Check out the Helm Chart for Kubernetes](https://github.com/authorizon/opal-helm-chart)

This one command will download and run a working configuration of OPAL server and OPAL client on your machine:

<br>

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/authorizon/opal/master/docker/docker-compose-example.yml \
> docker-compose.yml && docker-compose up
```

- üé® &nbsp; [Key concepts and design](docs/design.md) 
- üèóÔ∏è &nbsp; [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - OPAL consists of two key components that work together: 

    1. OPAL Server 
        - Creates a Pub/Sub channel clients subscribe to
        - Tracks a git repository (via webhook / polling) for updates to policy (or static data)
            - Additional versioned repositories can be supported (e.g. S3, SVN)
        - Accepts data update notifications via Rest API
        - pushes updates to clients (as diffs)
        - scales with other server instances via a configurable backbone pub/sub (Currently supported: Postgres, Redis, Kafka; more options will be added in the future)

    2. OPAL Client
        - Deployed alongside a policy-agent, and keeping it up to date
        - Subscribes to Pub/Sub updates, based on topics for data and policy 
        - Downloads data-source configurations from server
            - Fetches data from multiple sources (e.g. DBs, APIs, 3rd party services) 
        - Downloads policy from server
        - Keeps policy agents up to date
